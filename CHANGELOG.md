- Firefox only:
    - Fix copy and paste commands.
    - When upgrading, you will be asked to re-validate permissions.  The only
      new permission is "copy and paste to/from clipboard" (the
      `clipboardWrite` permission).  This is necessary to support copy/paste on
      Firefox.
- Various bug fixes.
- 1.62.1: Swap global and local marks (1.62.1).

```

- Other minor versions:
    - 1.62.2: Fixes [#2868](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/2868) (`createTab` with multiple URLs).

1.60 (2017-09-14)

- Features:
    - There's a new (advanced) option to ignore the keyboard layout; this can
      be helpful for users of non-Latin keyboards.
    - Firefox support.  This is a work in progress; please report any issues
      [here](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc);
      see the [add
      on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/).

- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed issue affecting hint placement when the display is zoomed.
    - Fixed search completion for Firefox (released as 1.59.1, Firefox only).

- Minor versions:
    - 1.60.1: fix [#2642](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/2642).
    - 1.60.2: revert previous fix for HiDPI screens.  This was breaking link-hint positioning for some users.
    - 1.60.3: [fix](https://github.com/philc/vimium/pull/2649) link-hint positioning.
    - 1.60.4: [fix](https://github.com/philc/vimium/pull/2602) hints opening in new tab (Firefox only).

1.59 (2017-04-07)

- Features:
    - Some commands now work on PDF tabs (`J`, `K`, `o`, `b`, etc.). Scrolling and other content-related commands still do not work.

1.58 (2017-03-08)

- Features:
    - The `createTab` command can now open specific URLs (e.g, `map X createTab http://www.bbc.com/news`).
    - With pass keys defined for a site (such as GMail), you can now use Vimium's bindings again with, for example, `map \ passNextKey normal`;
      this reactivates normal mode temporarily, but *without any pass keys*.
    - You can now map multi-modifier keys, for example: `<c-a-X>`.
    - Vimium can now do simple key mapping in some modes; see
      [here](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#key-mapping).
      This can be helpful with some non-English keyboards (and can also be used
      to remap `Escape`).
    - For *Custom key mappings* on the options page, lines which end with `\` are now continued on the following line.
- Process:
    - In order to provide faster bug fixes, we may in future push new releases without the noisy notification.

- Post-release minor fixes:
    - 1.58.1 (2017-03-09) fix bug in `LinkHints.activateModeWithQueue` (#2445).
    - 1.58.2 (2017-03-19) fix key handling bug (#2453).

1.57 (2016-10-01)

- New commands:
    - `toggleMuteTab` - mute or unmute the current tab (default binding
      `<a-m>`), see also [advanced usage](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#muting-tabs).
- Other new features:
    - You can now map `<backspace>` to a Vimium command (e.g. `map <backspace> goBack`).
    - For link hints, when one hint marker is covered by another, `<Space>` now
      rotates the stacking order.  If you use filtered hints, you'll need to
      use a modifier (e.g. `<c-Space>`).
- Changes:
    - Global marks now search for an existing matching tab by prefix (rather than exact match).
      This allows global marks to be used as quick bookmarks on sites (like Facebook, Gmail, etc)
      where the URL changes as you navigate around.
- Bug fixes:
    - `/i` can no longer hang Vimium while the page is loading.
    - `<c-a-[>` is no longer handled (incorrectly) as `Escape`.  This also affects `<Alt-Gr-[>`.
    - If `goX` is mapped, then `go` no longer launches the vomnibar.  This only affects three-key (or longer) bindings.

1.56 (2016-06-11)

- Vimium now works around a Chromium bug affecting users with non-standard keyboard layouts (see #2147).
- Fixed a bug preventing visual line mode (`V`) from working.

1.55 (2016-05-26)

- New commands:
    - `visitPreviousTab` - visit the previous tab (by recency) with `^`, or the tab before that with `2^`.
    - `passNextKey` - pass the next key to the page. For example, using `map <c-]> passNextKey`, you can close
      Facebook's messenger popups with `<c-]><Esc>`.
- Link hints:
    - Now work across all frames in the tab.
    - Now select frames and scrollable elements.
    - Now accept a count prefix; `3F` opens three new background tabs, `999F` opens many tabs.
    - For filtered link hints, a new option on the settings page requires you to press `Enter` to activate a
      link; this prevents unintentionally triggering Vimium commands with trailing keystrokes.
- Miscellaneous:
    - `gg` now accepts a `count` prefix.
    - `W` now accepts a count prefix; `3W` moves three tabs to a new window.
    - With smooth scrolling, `2j`-and-hold now gives a faster scroll than `j`-and-hold.
    - You can now bind keys to a command with a defined count prefix; for example, `map d scrollDown count=4`.
    - You can now bind three-key (or longer) sequences; for example, `map abc enterInsertMode`.
    - `c-y` and `c-e` now scroll in visual mode.
    - The Vimium help dialog has been re-styled.
- Bug fixes:
    - `<c-a-[>` is no longer treated as escape.
    - Fix icon display and memory leak due to a regression in recent Chrome versions (49+).
- For web-devs only:
    - When disabled on a tab, Vimium no longer pollutes the dev console with network requests.

- Fix occasional endless scrolling (#1911).

1.53 (2015-09-25)

- Vimium now works on the new-tab page for Chrome 47.
- `g0` and `g$` now accept count prefixes; so `2g0` selects the second tab, and so on.
- Bug fixes:
    - Fix `moveTabLeft` and `moveTabRight` for pinned tabs (#1814 and #1815).

1.52 (2015-09-09)

- Search completion for selected custom search engines
  (details on the [wiki](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Search-Completion)).
- Use `Tab` on an empty Vomnibar to repeat or edit recent queries
  (details on the [wiki](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#repeat-recent-vomnibar-queries)).
- Marks:
    - Use <tt>\`\`</tt> to jump back to the previous position after jump-like movements: <br/>
        (`gg`, `G`, `n`, `N`, `/` and local mark movements).
    - Global marks are now persistent and synced.
- For numeric link hints, you can now use `Tab` and `Enter` to select hints, and hints are ordered by the best
  match.
- The Find Mode text entry box now supports editing, pasting, and better handles non-latin characters.
- Vimium now works on XML pages.
- Bug fixes.

1.50 (2015-04-26)

- Visual mode (in beta): use `v` and then vim-like keystrokes to select text on the page. Use `y` to yank or
  `p` and `P` to search with your default search engine.. Please provide feedback on Github.
- Added the option to prevent pages from stealing focus from Vimium when loaded.
- Many bugfixes for custom search engines, and search engines can now have a description.
- Better support for frames: key exclusion rules are much improved and work within frames; the Vomnibar is
  always activated in the main frame; and a new command (`gF`) focuses the main frame.
- Find mode now has history. Use the up arrow to select previous searches.
- Ctrl and Shift when using link hints changes the tab in which links are opened in (reinstated feature).
- Focus input (`gi`) remembers previously-visited inputs.
