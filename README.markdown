Vimium - The Hacker's Browser
=============================

Vimium is a Chrome extension that provides keyboard based navigation and control in the spirit of the Vim
editor.

__Installation instructions:__

You can install the stable version of Vimium from the
[Chrome Extensions Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

Alternatively, you can install it from source:

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Click on "Load Extension..."
3. Select the vimium directory.

The Settings page can be found by clicking the Options button next to Vimium on chrome://extensions.

Keyboard Bindings
-----------------

Modifier keys are specified as follows: <c-x>, <m-x>, <a-x> for ctrl+x, meta+x, and alt+x
respectively.

Navigating the current page:
    h       scroll left
    j       scroll down
    k       scroll up
    l       scroll right
    gg      scroll to top of the page
    G       scroll to bottom of the page
    <c-d>, <c-e>   scroll down a page
    <c-u>, <c-y>   scroll up a page
    <c-f>   scroll down a full page
    <c-b>   scroll up a full page
    f       activate link hints mode to open in current tab
    F       activate link hints mode to open in new tab
    <a-f>   activate link hints mode to open multiple links in a new tab
    r       reload
    gs      view source
    zi      zoom in
    zo      zoom out
    /       enter find mode -- type your search query and hit enter to search or esc to cancel
    n       cycle forward to the next find match
    N       cycle backward to the previous find match
    i       enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit esc to exit
    yy      copy the current url to the clipboard
    gu      go up one level in the URL hierarchy
    gf      cycle forward to the next frame
    x       enable pass-thru mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit esc to exit

Navigating your history:
    H       go back in history
    L       go forward in history

Manipulating tabs:
    J, gT      go one tab left
    K, gt      go one tab right
    t          create tab
    d          close current tab
    u          restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'd' command)

Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting '5t' will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. ESC (or
<c-[>) will clear any partial commands in the queue.

Keys can be unmapped and remapped to different commands under Advanced Options.
