Vimium - The Hacker's Browser
=============================

Vimium is a Chrome extension that provides keyboard based navigation and control in the spirit of the Vim
editor.

__Installation instructions:__

You can install the stable version of Vimium from the
[Chrome Extensions Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

Alternatively, you can install it from source:

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle into Developer Mode
3. Click on "Load Unpacked Extension..."
4. Select the Vimium directory.

The Options page can be reached via a link on the help dialog (hit `?`) or via the button next to Vimium on
the Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).

Keyboard Bindings
-----------------

Modifier keys are specified as &lt;c-x&gt; &lt;m-x&gt;, &lt;a-x&gt; for ctrl+x, meta+x, and alt+x
respectively. See the next section for instructions on modifying these bindings.

Navigating the current page:

    ?       show the help dialog for a list of all available keys
    h       scroll left
    j       scroll down
    k       scroll up
    l       scroll right
    gg      scroll to top of the page
    G       scroll to bottom of the page
    d       scroll down half a page
    u       scroll up half a page
    f       open a link in the current tab
    F       open a link in a new tab
    r       reload
    gs      view source
    zi      zoom in
    zo      zoom out
    i       enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit esc to exit
    yy      copy the current url to the clipboard
    yf      copy a link url to the clipboard
    gf      cycle forward to the next frame

Using find:

    /       enter find mode -- type your search query and hit enter to search or esc to cancel
    n       cycle forward to the next find match
    N       cycle backward to the previous find match

Navigating your history:

    H       go back in history
    L       go forward in history

Manipulating tabs:

    J, gT      go one tab left
    K, gt      go one tab right
    t          create tab
    x          close current tab
    X          restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'x' command)

Additional advanced browsing commands:

    ]]      Follow the link labeled 'next' or '>'. Helpful for browsing paginated sites.
    [[      Follow the link labeled 'previous' or '<'. Helpful for browsing paginated sites.
    <a-f>   open multiple links in a new tab
    gi      focus the first (or n-th) text input box on the page
    gu      go up one level in the URL hierarchy
    zH      scroll all the way left
    zL      scroll all the way right
    z0      reset zoom to default value


Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting '5t' will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. ESC (or
&lt;c-[&gt;) will clear any partial commands in the queue and will also exit insert and find modes.


Custom Key Mappings
-------------------

You may remap or unmap any of the default key bindings in the "Key mappings" section under "Advanced Options"
on the options page.

Enter one of the following key mapping commands per line:

- `map key command`: Maps a key to a Vimium command. Overrides Chrome's default behavior (if any).
- `unmap key`: Unmaps a key and restores Chrome's default behavior (if any).
- `unmapAll`: Unmaps all bindings. This is useful if you want to completely wipe Vimium's defaults and start
  from scratch with your own setup.

Examples:

- `map <c-d> scrollPageDown` maps ctrl+d to scrolling the page down. Chrome's default behavior of bringing up
  a bookmark dialog is suppressed.
- `map r reload` maps the r key to reloading the page.
- `unmap <c-d>` removes any mapping for ctrl+d and restores Chrome's default behavior.
- `unmap r` removes any mapping for the r key.

Available Vimium commands can be found via the "Show Available Commands" link near the key mapping box. The
command name appears to the right of the description in parenthesis.

You can add comments to your key mappings by starting a line with `"` or `#`.

The following special keys are available for mapping:

- `<c-*>`, `<a-*>`, `<m-*>` for ctrl, alt, and meta (command on Mac) respectively with any key. Replace `*`
  with the key of choice.
- `<left>`, `<right>`, `<up>`, `<down>` for the arrow keys
- `<f1>` through `<f12>` for the function keys

Shifts are automatically detected so, for example, `<c-&>` corresponds to ctrl+shift+7 on an English keyboard.

does not support command repetition.
