Vimium - The Hacker's Browser
=============================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/philc/vimium.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/philc/vimium)

Vimium is a Chrome extension that provides keyboard-based navigation and control of the web in the spirit of
the Vim editor.

__Installation instructions:__

You can install the stable version of Vimium from the
[Chrome Extensions Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

Please see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-source)
for instructions on how you can install Vimium from source.

The Options page can be reached via a link on the help dialog (type `?`) or via the button next to Vimium on
the Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).

Keyboard Bindings
-----------------

Modifier keys are specified as `<c-x>`, `<m-x>`, and `<a-x>` for ctrl+x, meta+x, and alt+x
respectively. See the next section for how to customize these bindings.

Once you have Vimium installed, you can see this list of key bindings at any time by typing `?`.

Navigating the current page:

    ?       show the help dialog for a list of all available keys
    h       scroll left
    j       scroll down
    k       scroll up
    l       scroll right
    gg      scroll to top of the page
    G       scroll to bottom of the page
    d       scroll down half a page
    u       scroll up half a page
    f       open a link in the current tab
    F       open a link in a new tab
    r       reload
    gs      view source
    i       enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit Esc to exit
    yy      copy the current url to the clipboard
    yf      copy a link url to the clipboard
    gf      cycle forward to the next frame
    gF      focus the main/top frame

Navigating to new pages:

    o       Open URL, bookmark, or history entry
    O       Open URL, bookmark, history entry in a new tab
    b       Open bookmark
    B       Open bookmark in a new tab

Using find:

    /       enter find mode
              -- type your search query and hit enter to search, or Esc to cancel
    n       cycle forward to the next find match
    N       cycle backward to the previous find match

For advanced usage, see [regular expressions](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Find-Mode) on the wiki.

Navigating your history:

    H       go back in history
    L       go forward in history

Manipulating tabs:

    J, gT   go one tab left
    K, gt   go one tab right
    g0      go to the first tab
    g$      go to the last tab
    t       create tab
    yt      duplicate current tab
    x       close current tab
    X       restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'x' command)
    T       search through your open tabs
    <a-p>   pin/unpin current tab

Using marks:

    ma, mA  set local mark "a" (global mark "A")
    `a, `A  jump to local mark "a" (global mark "A")
    ``      jump back to the position before the previous jump
              -- that is, before the previous gg, G, n, N, / or `a

Additional advanced browsing commands:

    ]], [[  Follow the link labeled 'next' or '>' ('previous' or '<')
              - helpful for browsing paginated sites
    <a-f>   open multiple links in a new tab
    gi      focus the first (or n-th) text input box on the page
    gu      go up one level in the URL hierarchy
    gU      go up to root of the URL hierarchy
    zH      scroll all the way left
    zL      scroll all the way right
    v       enter visual mode; use p/P to paste-and-go, use y to yank
    V       enter visual line mode

Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting `5t` will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. `<Esc>` (or
`<c-[>`) will clear any partial commands in the queue and will also exit insert and find modes.

There are some advanced commands which aren't documented here; refer to the help dialog (type `?`) for a full
list.

Custom Key Mappings
-------------------

You may remap or unmap any of the default key bindings in the "Custom key mappings" on the options page.

Enter one of the following key mapping commands per line:

- `map key command`: Maps a key to a Vimium command. Overrides Chrome's default behavior (if any).
- `unmap key`: Unmaps a key and restores Chrome's default behavior (if any).
- `unmapAll`: Unmaps all bindings. This is useful if you want to completely wipe Vimium's defaults and start
  from scratch with your own setup.

Examples:

- `map <c-d> scrollPageDown` maps ctrl+d to scrolling the page down. Chrome's default behavior of bringing up
  a bookmark dialog is suppressed.
- `map r reload` maps the r key to reloading the page.
- `unmap <c-d>` removes any mapping for ctrl+d and restores Chrome's default behavior.
- `unmap r` removes any mapping for the r key.

Available Vimium commands can be found via the "Show available commands" link
near the key mapping box on the options page. The command name appears to the
right of the description in parenthesis.

You can add comments to key mappings by starting a line with `"` or `#`.

The following special keys are available for mapping:

- `<c-*>`, `<a-*>`, `<m-*>` for ctrl, alt, and meta (command on Mac) respectively with any key. Replace `*`
  with the key of choice.
- `<left>`, `<right>`, `<up>`, `<down>` for the arrow keys
- `<space>` for the space key
- `<f1>` through `<f12>` for the function keys

Shifts are automatically detected so, for example, `<c-&>` corresponds to ctrl+shift+7 on an English keyboard.

- Search completion for selected popular search engines; for details, see the wiki
  ([here](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Search-Completion) and
  [here](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#repeat-recent-queries)).

  jump-like movements (`gg`, `G`, `/`, `n`, `N` and local mark movements).
- Global marks are now persistent across tab closes and browser sessions, and
  are synced between browser instances.
- If link hints are filtered by text (see the options page, not the default), then `Tab` now selects the next available hint.
