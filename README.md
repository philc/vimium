Vimium - The Hacker's Browser
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/philc/vimium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/philc/vimium)

Vimium is a Chrome extension that provides keyboard-based navigation and control of the web in the spirit of
the Vim editor.

__Installation instructions:__

You can install the stable version of Vimium from the
[Chrome Extensions Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

Please see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-source)
for instructions on how you can install Vimium from source.

The Options page can be reached via a link on the help dialog (type `?`) or via the button next to Vimium on
the Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).

Keyboard Bindings
-----------------

Modifier keys are specified as `<c-x>`, `<m-x>`, and `<a-x>` for ctrl+x, meta+x, and alt+x
respectively. See the next section for how to customize these bindings.

Once you have Vimium installed, you can see this list of key bindings at any time by typing `?`.

Navigating the current page:

    ?       show the help dialog for a list of all available keys
    h       scroll left
    j       scroll down
    k       scroll up
    l       scroll right
    gg      scroll to top of the page
    G       scroll to bottom of the page
    d       scroll down half a page
    u       scroll up half a page
    f       open a link in the current tab
    F       open a link in a new tab
    r       reload
    gs      view source
    i       enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit Esc to exit
    yy      copy the current url to the clipboard
    yf      copy a link url to the clipboard
    gf      cycle forward to the next frame
    gF      focus the main/top frame

Navigating to new pages:

    o       Open URL, bookmark, or history entry
    O       Open URL, bookmark, history entry in a new tab
    b       Open bookmark
    B       Open bookmark in a new tab

Using find:

    /       enter find mode
              -- type your search query and hit enter to search, or Esc to cancel
    n       cycle forward to the next find match
    N       cycle backward to the previous find match

For advanced usage, see [regular expressions](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Find-Mode) on the wiki.

Navigating your history:

    H       go back in history
    L       go forward in history

Manipulating tabs:

    J, gT   go one tab left
    K, gt   go one tab right
    g0      go to the first tab
    g$      go to the last tab
    ^       visit the previously-visited tab
    t       create tab
    yt      duplicate current tab
    x       close current tab
    X       restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'x' command)
    T       search through your open tabs
    W       move current tab to new window
    <a-p>   pin/unpin current tab

Using marks:

    ma, mA  set local mark "a" (global mark "A")
    `a, `A  jump to local mark "a" (global mark "A")
    ``      jump back to the position before the previous jump
              -- that is, before the previous gg, G, n, N, / or `a

Additional advanced browsing commands:

    ]], [[  Follow the link labeled 'next' or '>' ('previous' or '<')
              - helpful for browsing paginated sites
    <a-f>   open multiple links in a new tab
    gi      focus the first (or n-th) text input box on the page
    gu      go up one level in the URL hierarchy
    gU      go up to root of the URL hierarchy
    ge      edit the current URL
    gE      edit the current URL and open in a new tab
    zH      scroll all the way left
    zL      scroll all the way right
    v       enter visual mode; use p/P to paste-and-go, use y to yank
    V       enter visual line mode

Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting `5t` will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. `<Esc>` (or
`<c-[>`) will clear any partial commands in the queue and will also exit insert and find modes.

There are some advanced commands which aren't documented here; refer to the help dialog (type `?`) for a full
list.

Custom Key Mappings
-------------------

You may remap or unmap any of the default key bindings in the "Custom key mappings" on the options page.

Enter one of the following key mapping commands per line:

- `map key command`: Maps a key to a Vimium command. Overrides Chrome's default behavior (if any).
- `unmap key`: Unmaps a key and restores Chrome's default behavior (if any).
- `unmapAll`: Unmaps all bindings. This is useful if you want to completely wipe Vimium's defaults and start
  from scratch with your own setup.

Examples:

- `map <c-d> scrollPageDown` maps ctrl+d to scrolling the page down. Chrome's default behavior of bringing up
  a bookmark dialog is suppressed.
- `map r reload` maps the r key to reloading the page.
- `unmap <c-d>` removes any mapping for ctrl+d and restores Chrome's default behavior.
- `unmap r` removes any mapping for the r key.

Available Vimium commands can be found via the "Show available commands" link
near the key mapping box on the options page. The command name appears to the
right of the description in parenthesis.

You can add comments to key mappings by starting a line with `"` or `#`.

The following special keys are available for mapping:

- `<c-*>`, `<a-*>`, `<m-*>` for ctrl, alt, and meta (command on Mac) respectively with any key. Replace `*`
  with the key of choice.
- `<left>`, `<right>`, `<up>`, `<down>` for the arrow keys.
- `<f1>` through `<f12>` for the function keys.
- `<space>` for the space key.
- `<tab>`, `<enter>`, `<delete>`, `<backspace>`, `<insert>`, `<home>` and `<end>` for the corresponding non-printable keys.

Shifts are automatically detected so, for example, `<c-&>` corresponds to ctrl+shift+7 on an English keyboard.

More documentation
------------------
Many of the more advanced or involved features are documented on
[Vimium's GitHub wiki](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki). Also
see the [FAQ](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/FAQ).

Firefox Support
---------------

There is an *experimental* port of Vimium on Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/).
This is very much experimental: most features work, although some bugs and issues remain.

PRs are welcome.

Release Notes
-------------

In `master` (not yet released)

- Backup and restore Vimium options (see the very bottom of the options page, below *Advanced Options*).

1.61 (2017-10-27)

- For *filtered hints*, you can now use alphabetical hint characters
  instead of digits; use `<Shift>` for hint characters.
- With `map R reload hard`, the reload command now asks Chrome to bypass its cache.
- You can now map `<c-[>` to a command (in which case it will not be treated as `Escape`).
- Various bug fixes, particularly for Firefox.
- Minor versions:
    - 1.61.1: Fix `map R reload hard`.

1.60 (2017-09-14)

- Features:
    - There's a new (advanced) option to ignore the keyboard layout; this can
      be helpful for users of non-Latin keyboards.
    - Firefox support.  This is a work in progress; please report any issues
      [here](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc);
      see the [add
      on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/).

- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed issue affecting hint placement when the display is zoomed.
    - Fixed search completion for Firefox (released as 1.59.1, Firefox only).

- Minor versions:
    - 1.60.1: fix [#2642](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/2642).
    - 1.60.2: revert previous fix for HiDPI screens.  This was breaking link-hint positioning for some users.
    - 1.60.3: [fix](https://github.com/philc/vimium/pull/2649) link-hint positioning.
    - 1.60.4: [fix](https://github.com/philc/vimium/pull/2602) hints opening in new tab (Firefox only).

1.59 (2017-04-07)

- Features:
    - Some commands now work on PDF tabs (`J`, `K`, `o`, `b`, etc.). Scrolling and other content-related commands still do not work.

1.58 (2017-03-08)

- Features:
    - The `createTab` command can now open specific URLs (e.g, `map X createTab http://www.bbc.com/news`).
    - With pass keys defined for a site (such as GMail), you can now use Vimium's bindings again with, for example, `map \ passNextKey normal`;
      this reactivates normal mode temporarily, but *without any pass keys*.
    - You can now map multi-modifier keys, for example: `<c-a-X>`.
    - Vimium can now do simple key mapping in some modes; see
      [here](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#key-mapping).
      This can be helpful with some non-English keyboards (and can also be used
      to remap `Escape`).
    - For *Custom key mappings* on the options page, lines which end with `\` are now continued on the following line.
- Process:
    - In order to provide faster bug fixes, we may in future push new releases without the noisy notification.

- Post-release minor fixes:
    - 1.58.1 (2017-03-09) fix bug in `LinkHints.activateModeWithQueue` (#2445).
    - 1.58.2 (2017-03-19) fix key handling bug (#2453).

1.57 (2016-10-01)

- New commands:
    - `toggleMuteTab` - mute or unmute the current tab (default binding
      `<a-m>`), see also [advanced usage](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#muting-tabs).
- Other new features:
    - You can now map `<backspace>` to a Vimium command (e.g. `map <backspace> goBack`).
    - For link hints, when one hint marker is covered by another, `<Space>` now
      rotates the stacking order.  If you use filtered hints, you'll need to
      use a modifier (e.g. `<c-Space>`).
- Changes:
    - Global marks now search for an existing matching tab by prefix (rather than exact match).
      This allows global marks to be used as quick bookmarks on sites (like Facebook, Gmail, etc)
      where the URL changes as you navigate around.
- Bug fixes:
    - `/i` can no longer hang Vimium while the page is loading.
    - `<c-a-[>` is no longer handled (incorrectly) as `Escape`.  This also affects `<Alt-Gr-[>`.
    - If `goX` is mapped, then `go` no longer launches the vomnibar.  This only affects three-key (or longer) bindings.

1.56 (2016-06-11)

- Vimium now works around a Chromium bug affecting users with non-standard keyboard layouts (see #2147).
- Fixed a bug preventing visual line mode (`V`) from working.

1.55 (2016-05-26)

- New commands:
    - `visitPreviousTab` - visit the previous tab (by recency) with `^`, or the tab before that with `2^`.
    - `passNextKey` - pass the next key to the page. For example, using `map <c-]> passNextKey`, you can close
      Facebook's messenger popups with `<c-]><Esc>`.
- Link hints:
    - Now work across all frames in the tab.
    - Now select frames and scrollable elements.
    - Now accept a count prefix; `3F` opens three new background tabs, `999F` opens many tabs.
    - For filtered link hints, a new option on the settings page requires you to press `Enter` to activate a
      link; this prevents unintentionally triggering Vimium commands with trailing keystrokes.
- Miscellaneous:
    - `gg` now accepts a `count` prefix.
    - `W` now accepts a count prefix; `3W` moves three tabs to a new window.
    - With smooth scrolling, `2j`-and-hold now gives a faster scroll than `j`-and-hold.
    - You can now bind keys to a command with a defined count prefix; for example, `map d scrollDown count=4`.
    - You can now bind three-key (or longer) sequences; for example, `map abc enterInsertMode`.
    - `c-y` and `c-e` now scroll in visual mode.
    - The Vimium help dialog has been re-styled.
- Bug fixes:
    - `<c-a-[>` is no longer treated as escape.
    - Fix icon display and memory leak due to a regression in recent Chrome versions (49+).
- For web-devs only:
    - When disabled on a tab, Vimium no longer pollutes the dev console with network requests.

1.54 (2016-01-30)

- Fix occasional endless scrolling (#1911).

1.53 (2015-09-25)

- Vimium now works on the new-tab page for Chrome 47.
- `g0` and `g$` now accept count prefixes; so `2g0` selects the second tab, and so on.
- Bug fixes:
    - Fix `moveTabLeft` and `moveTabRight` for pinned tabs (#1814 and #1815).

1.52 (2015-09-09)

- Search completion for selected custom search engines
  (details on the [wiki](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Search-Completion)).
- Use `Tab` on an empty Vomnibar to repeat or edit recent queries
  (details on the [wiki](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#repeat-recent-vomnibar-queries)).
- Marks:
    - Use <tt>\`\`</tt> to jump back to the previous position after jump-like movements: <br/>
        (`gg`, `G`, `n`, `N`, `/` and local mark movements).
    - Global marks are now persistent and synced.
- For numeric link hints, you can now use `Tab` and `Enter` to select hints, and hints are ordered by the best
  match.
- The Find Mode text entry box now supports editing, pasting, and better handles non-latin characters.
- Vimium now works on XML pages.
- Bug fixes.

1.51 (2015-05-02)

- Bug [fixes](https://github.com/philc/vimium/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+merged%3A%3E%3D2015-04-26+merged%3A%3C2015-05-02+state%3Amerged).

1.50 (2015-04-26)

- Visual mode (in beta): use `v` and then vim-like keystrokes to select text on the page. Use `y` to yank or
  `p` and `P` to search with your default search engine.. Please provide feedback on Github.
- Added the option to prevent pages from stealing focus from Vimium when loaded.
- Many bugfixes for custom search engines, and search engines can now have a description.
- Better support for frames: key exclusion rules are much improved and work within frames; the Vomnibar is
  always activated in the main frame; and a new command (`gF`) focuses the main frame.
- Find mode now has history. Use the up arrow to select previous searches.
- Ctrl and Shift when using link hints changes the tab in which links are opened in (reinstated feature).
- Focus input (`gi`) remembers previously-visited inputs.
- Bug fixes.
