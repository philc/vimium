# This file contains the definition of the completers used for the Vomnibox's suggestion UI. A completer will
# take a query (whatever the user typed into the Vomnibox) and return a list of Suggestions, e.g. bookmarks,
# domains, URLs from history.
#
# The Vomnibox frontend script makes a "filterCompleter" request to the background page, which in turn calls
# filter() on each these completers.
#
# A completer is a class which has three functions:
#  - filter(query, onComplete): "query" will be whatever the user typed into the Vomnibox.
#  - refresh(): (optional) refreshes the completer's data source (e.g. refetches the list of bookmarks).
#  - cancel(): (optional) cancels any pending, cancelable action.
