# This file contains the definition of the completers used for the Vomnibox's suggestion UI. A completer will
# take a query (whatever the user typed into the Vomnibox) and return a list of Suggestions, e.g. bookmarks,
# domains, URLs from history.
#
# The Vomnibox frontend script makes a "filterCompleter" request to the background page, which in turn calls
# filter() on each these completers.
#
# A completer is a class which has two functions:
#  - filter(query, onComplete): "query" will be whatever the user typed into the Vomnibox.
#  - refresh(): (optional) refreshes the completer's data source (e.g. refetches the list of bookmarks).

# A Suggestion is a bookmark or history entry which matches the current query.
# It also has an attached "computeRelevancyFunction" which determines how well this item matches the given
# query terms.
class Suggestion
  showRelevancy: false # Set this to true to render relevancy when debugging the ranking scores.

  # - type: one of [bookmark, history, tab].
  # - computeRelevancyFunction: a function which takes a Suggestion and returns a relevancy score
  #   between [0, 1]
  # - extraRelevancyData: data (like the History item itself) which may be used by the relevancy function.
