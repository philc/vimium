# A completion engine provides search suggestions for a custom search engine.  A custom search engine is
# identified by a "searchUrl".  An "engineUrl" is used for fetching suggestions, whereas a "searchUrl" is used
# for the actual search itself.
#
# Each completion engine defines:
#
#   1. An "engineUrl". This is the URL to use for search completions and is passed as the option "engineUrl"
#      to the "BaseEngine" constructor.
#
#   2. One or more regular expressions which define the custom search engine URLs for which the completion
#      engine will be used. This is passed as the "regexps" option to the "BaseEngine" constructor.
#
#   3. A "parse" function. This takes a successful XMLHttpRequest object (the request has completed
#      successfully), and returns a list of suggestions (a list of strings).  This method is always executed
#      within the context of a try/catch block, so errors do not propagate.
#
#   4. Each completion engine *must* include an example custom search engine.  The example must include an
#      example "keyword" and an example "searchUrl", and may include an example "description" and an
#      "explanation".
#
# Each new completion engine must be added to the list "CompletionEngines" at the bottom of this file.
#
# The lookup logic which uses these completion engines is in "./completion_search.coffee".
#

# A base class for common regexp-based matching engines. "options" must define:
#   options.engineUrl: the URL to use for the completion engine. This must be a string.
#   options.regexps: one or regular expressions.  This may either a single string or a list of strings.
#   options.example: an example object containing at least "keyword" and "searchUrl", and optional "description".
