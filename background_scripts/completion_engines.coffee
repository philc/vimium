# A completion engine provides search suggestions for a search engine.  A search engine is identified by a
# "searchUrl", e.g. Settings.get("searchUrl"), or a custom search engine URL.
#
# Each completion engine defines three functions:
#
#   1. "match" - This takes a searchUrl and returns a boolean indicating whether this completion engine can
#      perform completion for the given search engine.
#
#   2. "getUrl" - This takes a list of query terms (queryTerms) and generates a completion URL, that is, a URL
#      which will provide completions for this completion engine.
#
#   3. "parse" - This takes a successful XMLHttpRequest object (the request has completed successfully), and
#      returns a list of suggestions (a list of strings).  This method is always executed within the context
#      of a try/catch block, so errors do not propagate.
#
# Each new completion engine must be added to the list "CompletionEngines" at the bottom of this file.
#
# The lookup logic which uses these completion engines is in "./completion_search.coffee".
#
# NOTE(smblott).  When new completion engines are added or regular expressions are changed, re-run "cake
# builddoc" to generate the associated documentation.  See the "builddoc" target in Cakefile and
# "../misc/completion_engines/build.coffee".
