# This is a wrapper class for completion engines.  It handles the case where a custom search engine includes a
# prefix query term (or terms).  For example:
#
#   https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+%s
#
# In this case, we get better suggestions if we include the term "javascript" in queries sent to the
# completion engine.  This wrapper handles adding such prefixes to completion-engine queries and removing them
# from the resulting suggestions.
