#
# * Sync.set() and Sync.clear() propagate local changes to chrome.storage.sync.
# * Sync.handleStorageUpdate() listens for changes to chrome.storage.sync and propagates those
#   changes to localStorage and into vimium's internal state.
# * Sync.fetchAsync() polls chrome.storage.sync at startup, similarly propagating
#   changes to localStorage and into vimium's internal state.
#
# Changes are propagated into vimium's state using the same mechanism
# (Settings.performPostUpdateHook) that is used when options are changed on
# the options page.
#
# The effect is best-effort synchronization of vimium options/settings between
# chrome/vimium instances.
#
# NOTE:
#   Values handled within this module are ALWAYS already JSON.stringifed, so
#   they're always non-empty strings.
