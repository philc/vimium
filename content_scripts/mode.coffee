# Modes.
#
# A mode implements a number of keyboard event handlers which are pushed onto the handler stack when the mode
# starts, and poped when the mode exits.  The Mode base class takes as single argument options which can
# define:
#
# name:
#   A name for this mode.
#
# badge:
#   A badge (to appear on the browser popup) for this mode.
#   Optional.  Define a badge is the badge is constant.  Otherwise, do not define a badge and override the
#   chooseBadge method instead.  Or, if the mode *never* shows a badge, then do neither.
#
# keydown:
# keypress:
# keyup:
#   Key handlers.  Optional: provide these as required.  The default is to continue bubbling all key events.
#
# Additional handlers associated with the mode can be added by using the push method.  For example, if a mode
# responds to "focus" events, then push an additional handler:
#   @push
#     "focus": (event) => ....
# Any such additional handlers are removed when the mode exits.
#
# New mode types are created by inheriting from Mode or one of its sub-classes.  Some generic cub-classes are
# provided below:
#
#   SingletonMode: ensures that at most one instance of the mode is active at any one time.
#   ExitOnBlur: exits the mode if the an indicated element loses the focus.
#   ExitOnEscapeMode: exits the mode on escape.
#   StateMode: tracks the current Vimium state in @enabled and @passKeys.
#
# To install and existing mode, use:
#   myMode = new MyMode()
#
# To remove a mode, use:
#   myMode.exit() # externally triggered.
#   @exit()       # internally triggered (more common).
#

# For debug only; to be stripped out.
